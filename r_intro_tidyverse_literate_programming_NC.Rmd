## Learning Objectives

You will learn:

* What literate programming is and why it's important 
* How to use R Markdown for literate programming
* What the tidyverse is
* What data "wrangling" is
* Packages and functions used to tidy and wrangle data in R
* How to tidy and wrangle data with R


## Reproducibility 

For the purpose of this discussion, let's define:

* **_Replicate_**: to repeat a study (with new samples and data)
* **_Reproduce_**: to regenerate the results of an analysis (with the same data)

Our studies may be difficult to fully *replicate* ... but our analysis should always be *reproducible*.

Or in other words:

We should always be able to go from raw data to final results at any time ...
*and always get the same results* from the same data and the same analysis*.

`*` Even if you are doing modeling with randomly-generated values, you can set
the *seed* to produce the same values each time you run the analysis.

## Literate Programming

In the light of reproducibility, Literate Programming is:

Interspersing explanatory text with code to make a report that is executable 
and improves reproducibility. 

It allows a recipient to re-render the report to review the code/analysis and 
verify the results (including plots and figures).

## Literate Programming Tools

There are two main platforms for literate programming:

* **_Python_**: Jupyter Notebook (a future topic!)
* **_R_**: R Markdown and *knitr* (today's focus)

Both platforms can be used with other programming languages or a mix of them.


## R Markdown and *knitr*

To use R Markdown and *knitr* for Literate Programming, all you need is a text
editor, R, and a few packages such as *knitr*. These tools are well integrated into 
RStudio.

* R Markdown: The text notation you use for formatting, based on Markdown
* *knitr*: A package by Yihui Xie used to render R Markdown documents

## Installing R Markdown and *knitr*

You need the R packages *htmltools*, *rmarkdown* and *knitr*.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

install.packages(c("htmltools", "rmarkdown", "knitr"), dependencies = TRUE)
```


## R Markdown Syntax

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a "wiki" syntax based on 
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Here is an 
example:

## *knitr*

The R package which renders the R Markdown document is *knitr*. It uses other 
packages and utilities as needed to produce different document formats.

In RStudio, you would nomally run *knitr* using the *Knit HTML* button. 

If your document has been configured in R Markdown to generate a PDF document,
the the button will show as *Knit PDF*.

The appearance of the button changes depending on the document type.

You can also use the *File* -> *Knit Document* or *File* -> *Compile Notebook*
menu options.


## Creating a .Rmd file

Let's make our first .Rmd file. This is similar to making a script:

File -> New File -> R Markdown...

![](images/Rmd_save.png)

Be sure to save it! "onramp_example.Rmd" works


## Features of the Markdown Document 

* YAML Header
* Text
* Code chunks

## Introduction to the Tidyverse

Before we get into data wrangling, let's look at the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. 
All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# install all of the tidyverse packages to start (this might take a little time)
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

There are tidyverse packages for data wrangling, modeling, and visualization.

## Data wrangling with *dplyr*

"[*dplyr*](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is a grammar of data manipulation, 
providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data 
manipulation challenges"

Common functions include:

* Creating new variables 
* Choosing variables based on their name 
* Choosing rows based on a condition 
* Grouping data by a variable 


```{r}
# load pacman, installing if needed
if(!require("pacman")){install.packages("pacman", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")}

# load packages as needed (dplyr for wrangling; ggplo2 for data visualization)
pacman::p_load(dplyr, ggplot2)

```

## Example Dataset `airquality`

R has many built-in datasets - let's get a dataset on air quality from New York in 1973. 

```{r}

# load the "airquality" dataset into the environment
data(airquality)

## explore its attributes
# show the class of the dataset
class(airquality)

# displays the first several rows of data
head(airquality)

# display the dimensions (153 rows and 6 columns of the dataset)
dim(airquality)


```


## Wranlge *airqualtiy*

Common data tasks are simplified with dplyr, once you learn the verbs.

Let's add a variable to airquality using `mutate()`

```{r}

# Add the year of the measurements and look at the first 10 rows
head(mutate(airquality, Year = 1973), n = 10)

```

## Wrangle *airquality*

Let's take a look at the new `airquality` dataframe.

```{r}
# show the dataframe, looking at the first few rows
head(airquality)

```

What happened here? Where did the `Year` column go? In our previous step, a dataframe printed to the console with the new `Year` variable, but it did not change the `airquality` object in the environment.

We performed a task on the original `airquality` object, but since we did not make a new assignment, the change was not "saved" to the object in the environment.

## Wrangle *airquality*

Now we'll add `Year` and make a new assignment 

```{r}
# Add year to the dataframe
airquality <- mutate(airquality, Year = 1973)

# take a look!
head(airquality)
```

Better! 

## Wrangle *airquality*

Now let's create a date column. We'll create a character string first to break the steps down.

```{r}
#make a character variable, then a date variable
airquality <- mutate(airquality, Date_char = paste(Year, Month, Day, sep = "-"))
airquality <- mutate(airquality, Date = as.Date(Date_char, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))

head(airquality)

# check the class
class(airquality$Date)

```

## Wrangle *airquality*

Say were only interested in data from May, let's filter our data now. The filter function takes a logical condition, requiring `==` which is different than `=` when we are assigning variables within functions.
```{r}
airquality <- filter(airquality, Month == 5)
head(airquality)
```

Great, that's what we were expecting.

## Wrangle *airquality*

Next, let's consider the pipe operator `%>%` which will help us streamline these operations so it is clear and more succinct. The pipe operator feeds the output of one function into the input of the next, avoiding having to make multiple assignments.

```{r}

# reload dataset to start fresh
data(airquality)

# wrangle airquality with pipe operators
airquality_may <- airquality %>% 
  
  # add year, and date variables using mutate
  mutate(Year = 1973,
         Date_char = paste(Year, Month, Day, sep = "-"), 
         Date = as.Date(Date_char, format = "%Y-%m-%d")) %>% 
  
  # filter dataframe to the month of May
  filter(Month == 5) %>% 
  
  # select the variables of interest
  select(Ozone, Temp, Date)
```

## Wrangle *airquality*

Let's take a look.

```{r}

# show the dataframe
head(airquality_may)
```

## Wrangle *airquality*

What if we're interested in the average ozone and temperature by month? Would we have to repeat this process for each month? dplyr has easy and powerful functions to perform data wrangling tasks on groups: `group_by()` and `summarise()`

```{r}

# average by month, note the argument `na.rm = TRUE` is required to ignore the 
# NA values. Otherwise NA would be returned 
airquality_by_month <- airquality %>% 
  
  # group dataframe by month
  group_by(Month) %>% 
  
  # calculate average ozone concentration and temperature
  summarise(Ozone_avg = mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE), 
            Temp_avg = mean(Temp, na.rm = TRUE))

```

## Wrangle *airquality*

```{r}
# show new dataframe
airquality_by_month

```


## Make a plot using *ggplot2*

Now let's make a simple plot so we have an example for our rendered document. The goal here is just to introduce the main plotting tool of the Tidyverse - we'll be covering *ggplot2* in more detail in the future.

```{r}

# initialize ggplot
p <- ggplot(data = airquality_may) + 
  
  # specify the type of geometry and the aesthetic features
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Ozone)) + 
  
  # specify labels
  labs(y = "Ozone Conc. (ppb)") + 
  
  # choose theme
  theme_classic()
  
```

## Make a plot using *ggplot2*

```{r}
# show plot
print(p)

```


## Render Markdown Document

Next, let's render the document using the "Knit" button.
